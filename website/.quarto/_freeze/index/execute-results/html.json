Stock Synthesis has evolved over time to be able to model a wide range of fish populations and dynamics. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differention though AD Model Builder [ADMB](https://www.admb-project.org/).\n\nSS3 is made up of:\n\n-   A population sub-model that simulates a stock's:\n    -   growth,\n    -   maturity,\n    -   fecundity,\n    -   recruitment,\n    -   movement, and\n    -   mortality processes,\n-   An observation sub-model that estimates expected values for various types of data,\n-   A statistical sub-model characterizes the data's goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance, and\n-   A forecast sub-model projects needed management quantities.\n\n## Getting Started with Stock Synthesis\n\nTo getting started with Stock Synthesis, please see the presentation below and the [Getting Started with Stock Synthesis Tutorial](qmds/getting_started_ss3.qmd):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SS3_Getting_Started.pdf){width=85% height=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## How to Cite Stock Synthesis\n\nPlease cite Stock Synthesis as:\n\n```         \nMethot, R.D. and Wetzel, C.R.
