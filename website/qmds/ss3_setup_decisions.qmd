## Model dimensions to figure out before adding data
### Areas
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: Number of areas
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining the number of areas you should have in your 
    SS3 model. Simply put, the diagram shows that if you have lots of data, 
    limited movement, and evidence of significant spatial differences in growth 
    or relative stock size, then you should use more than one area.
    }
    A["How many areas should I have?"] --> B["Do I have lots of data"]
    B -- Yes --> C["Is there limited movement"]
    C -- Yes --> D["Is there evidence of significant spatial 
                    differences in growth or relative stock size?"]
    D -- Yes --> E("Use more than one area")
    B -- No --> F("Use one area")
    C -- No --> F
    D -- No --> F

### Seasons
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: Number of seasons
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining the number of seasons you should use in your 
    SS3 model. Simply put, the diagram shows that if you have a short-lived, fast 
    growing species and are using length data or if you don't have a short-lived, 
    fast growing species but fishing is during a short season that precedes the 
    survey or spawning then you should use multiple seasons. Otherwise, use one 
    season.
    }
    A["How many seasons should I have?"] --> B["Is it a short-lived, 
                                                fast growing species?"]
    B -- Yes --> C["Am I using length data?"]
    C --Yes --> D("Use multiple seasons")
    C -- No --> E("Use one season")
    B -- No --> F["Is fishing during a short season that 
                  precedes the survey or spawning?"]
    F -- Yes --> D

### Empirical weight-at-age (EWWA) vs. parametric growth
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: Empirical weight-at-age (EWWA) versus parametric growth
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining if you should use empirical weight-at-age or 
    parametric growth in you should use in your SS3 model. Simply put, the diagram 
    shows that if you have lots of age data and there is evidence of variability 
    in weight-at-age, then you should use empirical-weight-at-age, otherwise you 
    should use parametric growth.
    }
    A["Should I use EWAA or parametric growth?"] --> B["Do I have lots of age data"]
    B -- Yes --> C["Is there evidence of variability 
                  in weight-at-age"]
    C -- Yes --> D("Use EWWA")
    B -- No --> E("Use parametric growth")
    C -- No --> E

### Fleets
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: Number of fleets
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining the number of fleets you should use in your 
    SS3 model. Simply put, the diagram shows that if you have significant differences in the size 
    composition of the catch of different subsets of the fishery or there is some 
    management reason to model the catch separately, then use multiple fleets, 
    otherwise group all the catch as one fleet.
    }
    A["How many fleets should I have?"] --> B["Are there significant differences in size
                                              composition of the catch of different subsets
                                              of the fishery?"]
    B --Yes --> C("Multiple fleets")
    B -- No --> D["Is there some management reason to 
                  model the catch separately?"]
    D -- Yes --> C
    D -- No --> E("Group all catch as one fleet")

### One sex or two
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: One sex or two
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining if you should use one sex or two you should use in your 
    SS3 model. Simply put, the diagram shows that if you have sex-specific composition data (age or length) or you are modeling growth and the species is sexually dimorphic, then you should use two sexes, otherwise you should use one sex.
    }
    A["Should I have one sex or two"] --> B["Am I modeling growth?"]
    B -- Yes --> C["Is the species sexually dimorphic?"]
    C -- Yes --> D("Use two sexes")
    A --> E["Do I have sex-specific composition data?"]
    E -- Yes --> D
    B -- No --> F("Combine females and males into one sex")
    C -- No --> F
    E -- No --> F

```


### Number of population age bins
Data age bins should cover the majority of the observed ages (*i.e.* not too large that a fraction is in the maximum age/plus group).

The first age is always 0, but recruitment can occur at age 1.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    accTitle: Number of population age bins
    accDescr: {
    Decision process for determining the if the population age bins can go higher 
    than the data age bins. Simply put, the diagram shows that if growth is 
    asymptotic within the observed ages or if the unfished equilibrium is 
    estimated to have older fish than has been observed then the population age 
    bins can go higher than the data age bins. Otherwise, the population age bins 
    can't go higher than the data age bins.
    }
    A["Can population age bins go 
      higher than data age bins?"] --> B["Is growth asymptotic within
                                                observed ages?"]
    B -- No --> C["Is unfished equilibrium estimated to 
                  have older fish than has been observed?"]                                    
    B -- Yes --> D("Population age bins can go 
                   higher than data age bins")
    C -- Yes --> D
    C -- No --> E("Population age bins can't go 
                  higher than data age bins")
    linkStyle 1,2,3,4 stroke-width:2px,color:black
    style D fill:#5EB6D9
    style E fill:#5EB6D9
```

In models with growth, the plus group should be old enough so that fish nearly achieve $L_{inf}$ by the time they are in the plus group.
