Welcome to the Stock Synthesis website!

## Introduction

Stock Synthesis (SS3) is an age- and size-structured stock assessment model in the class of models termed integrated analysis. Stock Synthesis has evolved over time to be able to model a wide range of fish population dynamics and somatic growth and to utilize diverse types of data. The model is coded in C++ with parameter estimation enabled by automatic differentiation though AD Model Builder [ADMB](https://www.admb-project.org/).

SS3 is made up of

-   A population sub-model that simulates the following population processes:
    -   biology (growth, maturity, fecundity),
    -   recruitment,
    -   movement, 
    -   fishery selectivity
    -   natural and fishing mortality, and
    -   responsiveness to environmental and predation factors.
-   An observation sub-model that estimates expected values for various types of data.
-   A statistical sub-model that characterizes the data's goodness of fit and obtains best-fitting parameters with associated variance.
-   A forecast sub-model that projects management quantities.

There are 100+ stocks in the US and throughout the world that use SS3 for which we have provided many national, international, and web-based trainings on SS3. Additionally, we have a very active user-base that contributes heavily to SS3 and the associated R packages as well as participating in the online discussions and forums.

![](qmds/images/icon-download.png){fig-align="left" height="03%" width="03%" fig-alt="download icon"} 
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/releases/latest) of the Stock Synthesis executable. 

To see the changes made in the latest release of Stock Synthesis, please see the [change log on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-ost/projects/11) that shows all changes from v.3.30.19 onward. To see the change log for versions prior to v.3.30.19, please download [this Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/blob/v3.30.19/Change_log_for_SS_3.30.xlsx?raw=true).

## Getting Started with Stock Synthesis
To get started with Stock Synthesis, please see the presentation below and the [Getting Started with Stock Synthesis Tutorial](qmds/getting_started_ss3.qmd):

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%", out.height= "400px", fig.alt="pdf of Getting Started presentation"}

```

### Getting Started Using the Stock Assessment Continuum Tool
If you are just getting started with Stock Synthesis, we highly recommend downloading the [Stock Assessment Continuum Tool](https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool), a shiny app (pictured below) where users can provide data and life-history information to create the Stock Synthesis input files, run the model, and produce plots and tables via the [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package.
![](qmds/images/stock_assess_continuation_tool.png){width="90%" fig-alt="Picture of the stock assessment continuum tool shiny app."}

### Getting Started Using the Input Files
To learn more about how to build your own models in Stock Synthesis using the input files directly, see the [Develop a Stock Synthesis model](qmds/ss3_model_tips.qmd) guide.

### Interacting with Stock Synthesis and Viewing Output Using {r4ss}
![](qmds/images/r4ss_logo.png){style="float: right;" fig-align="right" width="110" height="130" fig-alt="r4ss package hex logo"}

The [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) package is a collection of R functions for interacting with Stock Synthesis. These functions include downloading the executable, changing model input, running the model, and creating an assortment of plots and tables. More information about using [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) is available in the ["Introduction to r4ss"](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/articles/r4ss-intro-vignette.html) vignette. Furthermore, you can navigate to these [example plots](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/BigSkate) that were created using [{r4ss}](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) for the Big Skate model, which can be found in the [ss3-test-models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-test-models) repository.

### User Example Models
We maintain a GitHub repository of [example stock synthesis models](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples) for users. Information on what the key features of the user example models are and how to download them can be found in the [SS3 user examples repository](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-user-examples#readme).

## Asking questions about Stock Synthesis
Questions can be asked by contributing to a [discussion](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/discussions) in the Stock Synthesis source code repository or by emailing nmfs.stock.synthesis@noaa.gov.You can also look for answers or submit questions to the [Stock Synthesis forums](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/public-forums). Note that an account is required to ask questions on the forums.  
**We are moving to GitHub for most of our communications, so we generally prefer that users start with posting to GitHub discussions before trying other methods of communicating with the SS3 Team.**

## Contributing to Stock Synthesis
Have feature requests or bug reports? Want to contribute code? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/issues). If you are able to contribute code to fix the issue or add a feature, then the SS3 Team will communicate with you after which you will be able to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/compare) from your fork of the repository to be reviewed by the SS3 Team. Even Team members cannot directly contribute to the ss3-source-code without a pull request.
